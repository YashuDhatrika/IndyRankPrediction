# IndyRankPrediction

Advances in Machine Learning and Deep Learning today have paved way for solving more and more problems. One such challenge is predicting the rank of cars in races. This is particularly a difficult problem because of the uncertainty involved and interplay of a large number of factor involved. However, with the availability of large amount of data from sensors and other sources, we are optimistic about the possibility of finding some patterns that affect the ranking more than others. In this view, we are working on forecasting ranking and studying variables involved of Indianapolis 500 race.The race involves around 33 cars which compete for 200 laps for across 7 years (2013-2019) .Numerous sensors collect data in real time such as vehicle speed,engine speed, throttle, lap times, etc. The size of this data could be between 500 MB to 2 GB.In this project, the main objective is to analyze the data given,clean it and build model that can forecast ranking of cars. We have performed the various steps like Data Extraction, Data Preprocessing ,Exploratory Data Analysis to get more understanding of the data and applying a various models (Linear,Bagging and Boosting, Deep Learning Models) to accurately predict the rankings.
